# Palindrome Checker

A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization. For example, "racecar" and "A man, a plan, a canal. Panama" are palindromes.

## Purpose

The **Palindrome Checker** is a simple web-based tool that allows users to determine whether a given input is a palindrome. It can handle various cases, including sentences with spaces, punctuation, and mixed capitalization. This tool is ideal for learning about string manipulation, case conversion, and character filtering in programming.

## Requirements
- **Web Browser**: Modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.

## How to Use

1. **Open the Palindrome Checker app**: Access the application through the provided link or by running it locally.
2. **Enter text**: Input a word, phrase, or sentence into the text field labeled "Enter text here".
3. **Check for palindrome**: Click the "Check" button to determine if the input is a palindrome.
4. **View results**: The result will indicate whether the input is a palindrome and display the processed version of the input.

## Examples

Here are some examples you can try:

| Input                              | Output                                       |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `A`                               | `A is a palindrome`                         |
| `eye`                             | `eye is a palindrome`                       |
| `_eye`                            | `_eye is a palindrome`                      |
| `race car`                        | `race car is a palindrome`                  |
| `A man, a plan, a canal. Panama`  | `A man, a plan, a canal. Panama is a palindrome` |
| `not a palindrome`                | `not a palindrome is not a palindrome`      |
| `My age is 0, 0 si ega ym.`       | `My age is 0, 0 si ega ym. is a palindrome` |
| `five|_/|four`                    | `five|_/|four is not a palindrome`          |
